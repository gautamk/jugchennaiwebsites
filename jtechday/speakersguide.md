Following are some helpful guidelines for speakers to keep in mind when submitting or creating presentations.

### Topic Description

* Not more than 750 characters.
* Focus on the technology you will be talking about
* Why is this technology/topic useful to the attendees
* What is the listener going to learn out of this session


### Speaker's Personal Bio

* Some points to focus are Name, Claim to Fame, Important Accomplishment, Contact Information
* Always write in 3rd person.
* Bring clear picture of your skill, experience, passion and achievement.
* Keep it 750 characters max.


### Presentation Notes

* Place your name and presentation title on the first slide
* Use pages to list your credentials / bio so the audience know about you.
* Font Size: This is easily the most commonly encountered issue in presentations. Please use 30+ font size for the slide content.
* Hazy / Cluttered Images : We also encounter this one very frequently. If you are adding an image, consider if the person at the back of the hall would be able to see and comprehend what's displayed.
* Dumped Info on each slide: Use minimum amount of text on each slide. Try to use 30 characters per line and 10 lines per slide
* Images and Graphs often speak louder than words
* Use lower case characters instead of CAPITALS, Use big and bold them to emphasize
* Avoid dark coloured backgrounds with black text - it becomes hard to read
* Images Make it Interesting: Adding a lot of relevant or at times fun images can livn up your slide deck..
* No Marketing: Please ensure that there is no marketing content for any product/service/company in your slides.
* Code, Code, Code: When you give technical presentation try to provide code snippets.
