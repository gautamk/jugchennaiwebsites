Anywhere’ to include the GPU.An API used to express data parallel workloads in Java and a runtime system capable of running compatible workloads on a
compatible GPU. The advantages include Data Parallelism for Java Developers. It allows java developers to exploit the compute power of GPU and APU

What the API does:

– Converts Java byte codes to OpenCL codes at Runtime and runs
on GPU
– If Aparapi for some reasons not able to execute on GPU it will
execute in Java thread pool.
